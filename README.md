## Simple and non-invasive add-on for parametric primitives in Blender
###	This Blender add-on provides easily-accessible shortcuts for parametric geometrical primitives in the already-existing Shift+A menu (exactly where they so obviously belong) No extra buttons, no extra internal-features, no state logic stored in the .blend files themselves. The parametric primitives are implemented using already-existing blender features, and thus completley manually-editable and compatible even when this add-on is absent.
